# Hey, I'm Dan ðŸ‘‹

You can call me **@danships** here because _@debuggingdan_ was already taken (justice for stolen handles ðŸ˜¤).

I've been building applications for 20+ years â€” from the days of PHP spaghetti to full-stack Node, React, and Next.js. Since 2017, Iâ€™ve also been deep in the world of conversational AI, LLMs (a little), and stitching together smart systems that (ideally) just work.

These days Iâ€™m mostly playing with:
- LLMs and agentic systems
- Multi-model setups and smart orchestration
- Automation that feels like magic

## ðŸ›  Projects Iâ€™m building / poking at

- **[Genie Nexus](https://github.com/danships/genie-nexus)** â€“ API router for LLMs and regular HTTP calls. Open source + SaaS flavor at [gnxs.io](https://gnxs.io)
- **[Supersave](https://github.com/supersavehq/supersave)** â€“ A library to create a simple datastore on top of a database with a generic API.
- **[datasthor](https://www.datasthor.com)** â€“ Dead simple API for storing app/user files without building a whole backend.

## ðŸŽ™ Stuff I Share

- **YouTube**: [DebuggingDan](https://www.youtube.com/@debuggingdan) â€” podcast on building side projects, building in public, and livestreamed dev sessions building my projects.
